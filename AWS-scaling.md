## SUMMARY

This project takes alook at Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups.
It explores the significance of High availability and Scalability in cloud infrastructure and the role of Load Balancers in ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
We will demonstrate how to set up an Application Load Balancer and configure Auto Scaling Groups.
For this project, we created an application load balancer to handle HTTP traffic, created a target group and also registered the target group, ensuring that the security groups allow HTTP traffic to port 80.
Finally, We will simulate an unhealthy instance to showcase how Autoscaling groups automatically adjust the number of resources based on changing demand or workload.
